<p>
  dependency injection - DI is a coding pattern in which a class receives its
  dependencies from external sources rather thatn creating them itself.
</p>
<p>Code without DI- drawbacks <br />- not flexible</p>

<div *ngIf="employees">
  {{ employees | json }}<br /><br />
  <p>Employee Names</p>
  <div *ngFor="let employee of employees">
    <span>{{ employee.name }}</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>DI as a design pattern</p>
<p>DI as a framework</p>
